      We adopt and support key free and open-source Minecraft projects to make
      open creation sustainable. By working closely with creators and
      communities, we're building an ecosystem where everyone — from individuals
      to large studios — has the freedom to create, the support to grow, and the
      tools to power the future of Minecraft.
