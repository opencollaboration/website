Been able to allocate more time to review the site further & push some of my changes:
a .gitignore would be very nice

Main:
why are we ignoring the system preference for light/dark?
can we split the .svg's into separate files?
the hamburger menu button appears but isn't clickable when the site is "squished" on desktop
would be nice to remove/hide the outline on the main logo / partner logos, although it is great to see them not being draggable anymore
Can we make the "our partners" caroussel a bit larger & include a brief description? I'll get you the logos / texts on that one tomorrow
the yellow on the "get involved" section looks out of place

Footer:
Navigation links are borked; pls fix
the "Get in touch" section feels a bit uselss there, would rather link those socials under info. Please link these: contact@opencollaboration.dev, https://x.com/opencollaboration, and https://github.com/opencollaboration
can we somehow re-use the footer across pages? same for header; this does not feel intuitive to modify

Our team: page is completely broken :(

For the "join us" page, see ⁠Chris⁠ - can't really draft it better then that xd

I've pushed a few of my proposed changes to a branch; the lack of a .gitignore makes it difficult to track what should(n't) be committed :(
